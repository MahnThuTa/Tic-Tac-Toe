# Tic-Tac-Toe

#### Video Demo:  `<URL HERE>`

#### Description:

* This project is a game, Tic Tac Toe game. Two players are allowed but i will do the one player version with computer after this submission. This is a simple game, players have to input a number between 1 to 9 up to their turn and the program will do the rest. I used OOP since it is better for recalling variable and I also used Tabulate for better design rather than using "|". The OS module is a new for me, i have to read documentations about it while doing this project and it does a simple thing. It clear the terminal for you so that the terminal won't mess with tables and inputs. The OS named "nt" is Microsoft Window, it use "cls" to clear the terminal but the other OS use "clear". The classmetod is used to recreate a whole new program. The check_spots file is used for checking the spots if one of the players has won. This is my project for CS50, I hope you all like it and don't mind about my grammar, I am still learnigðŸ˜Š.
