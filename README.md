# Tic-Tac-Toe

#### Video Demo:  `<URL HERE>`


#### Description:

* This project is a game, Tic Tac Toe game. Two players are allowed. I used OOP since it is better for recalling variable and I also used Tabulate for better design rather than using "|". The OS module is a new for me and it does a simple thing. It clears the terminal for you so that the terminal won't mess with tables and inputs. The OS named "nt" is Microsoft Window, it uses "cls" to clear the terminal but the other OS use "clear". The classmetod is used to recreate a whole new program. The check_spots file is used for checking the spots if one of the players has won. This is my project for CS50, I hope you all like it and don't mind about my grammar, I am still learnigðŸ˜Š.


#### Features:

* Replace the input number with O or X up to their turn

* The game ends if a player has won.

* Tie if no one wins.

* The terminal clear after each input.


#### How to use:

* Players have to input number between 1 to 9 up to their turn.

* If the game is tie you can rematch by typing "yes" otherwise "no".
